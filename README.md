# Confetti Form
A simple web form that shows confetti animations for users with birth years ending in "5" or "0".

## Description
This project contains an HTML form that collects user information including first name, last name, email, and date of birth. When the form is submitted, it checks the last digit of the birth year and launches a confetti animation if the year ends in "5" or "0". If the year does not end in "5" or "0", it shows an alert message.
